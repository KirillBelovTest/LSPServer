# Compatibility


## Source Compatibility

LSPServer has source compatibility with 12.0+


## FrontEnd Compatibility

Any source .wl files that have `(* ::Package::"Tags" *)` or `(* ::Code::Initialization::"Tags" *)` syntax may only be edited with a version 12.3+ FE 


## WolframVersion

WolframVersion in PacletInfo is 12.1+ to maintain the same minimum required version as CodeParser


## CCompilerDriver libraries

This table show the value of -mmacosx-version-min for libraries generated by CCompilerDriver:

| Wolfram version | MacOSX-x86-64 | MacOSX-ARM64 |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 12.0            | 10.10         | N/A          |
| 12.1            | 10.10         | N/A          |
| 12.2            | 10.12         | 11.0         |
| 12.3            | 10.14         | 11.0         |
| 13.0            | 10.14         | 11.0         |
| 13.1            | 10.14         | 11.0         |

LSPServer sets the same macosx-version-min in order to achieve maximum compatibility with libraries generated by CCompilerDriver.


## Earlier Versions

Manually modify WolframVersion in PacletInfo.wl to allow the paclet to be used.

The message that you get when you install the paclet:
```
The paclet CodeParser was successfully installed.
```
does not necessarily mean that the paclet can be used.

Make sure that the correct WolframVersion is specified.


## WolframLanguageSyntax Compatibility

Only the latest released version of Wolfram System is supported.
